<title>About Me</title>
<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Self thought full stack web developer.</p>
<p>Currently I'm an Operations Manager in Logistics, but slowly following my dream of becoming a developer.</p>

<p>I've always been interested in technology, computers, but never dared to take time to learn how to get in the industry. With time i've learned
  that everything is possible with time and dedication. 
  <p>Why a developer you might ask ?</p>
  Well it's like being a kid again, playing with all sorts of toys and taking them apart, then try to rebuild it yourself or even try to modify them. As a developer you solve problems
  and build projects from the ground, building from nothing to something is always special, it ain't easy but the joy and the fullfilment I get from that
  cannot be expressed with words.
</p>

<p>Building something takes patience and time, even Rome wasn't built in a single day.</p>
<p>One of my favourite quotes: "You might not think that programers are artists, but programing is an extremely creative proffesion.
  Its logic-based creativity"
